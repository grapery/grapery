## interview

I graduated from SCUT university with a Bachelor's degree in computer software in 2012。
Since then, I have been working in software development and have experienced four different companies。
At the beginning, I was doing C++ development. Later, because I wanted to do some web service development, and I learned the go language in 2010, I switched to go language development two years later, and it has been up to now. Using go language to develop single services and distributed systems makes me enjoy programming

In addition to these：

I like Playing football, hiking, and reading history and economics, but also interested in cutting-edge physics.
Since I am doing information system development, I sometimes try to interpret history from the perspective of a distributed information processing system. 
This is very interesting and it is easy to help myself understand some things in history.
